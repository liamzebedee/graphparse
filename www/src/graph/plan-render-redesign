rendering algorithm benefits:
declarative style means better flexibility

basically:

(nodes, edges) -> layout -> (nodes[@,x,y], edges[@,x,y]) -> agg(nodes, edges) -> (nodes[@,x,y,edges]) -> render


render algorithm will look like:

node:
    rootnode
    render(rootnode.children, renderDepth--) ->




what am I trying to do?
 - make rendering look prettier and more manipulable from an interface level.

render the root nodes
