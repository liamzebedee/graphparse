 - oh that's why there's only 8 files - it ignores GOOS-unspecific files
 - make([]T, 16) makes an array with 16 nil entries
 - you can do []T{} which is better
 - also the for loop condition haha

 - you cannot pass store.something as a prop call to an event handler. Because store likely is null when you give it? and the reference may not be passed through/bound to this? 

 - return Variant() == Struct || Variant == RootPackage needs to be bracketed. Much clearer to write it with a switch case.
