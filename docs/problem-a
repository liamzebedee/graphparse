ignore webapi
select globals

nonono

if I want to enncapsulate a type
define what the interface will look like


we want to return Graph.toJSON()
so we need to encapsulate Graph's functionnality like `graph = GenerateCodeGraph(repo)`
we need to see where Graph is used
and what other 'global variables' it relies on

1. search Graph
where is Graph set

GenerateCodeGraph

okay now we need to isolate the dependencies
pretty much



globals = (Nodes where File).children depth=1



we need to include external types for file globals (? yes)
